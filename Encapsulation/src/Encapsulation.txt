What is Encapsulation?
-> Encapsulation in Java is the process of providing security to the most important data.
And providing controlled access using getters and setters to access and modify the data.

Example: If we make a program to store students data about a school. We might have "Student" object
This object could contain student details like name, id, grades etc as well as methods to calculate
average grades.

If we don't provide security to the data like name, grades etc. Any one could access the data from
anywhere and modify the data without consent. So to provide security to data we usually use the 
private keyword so that it is accessible only to the class.

But if the administrator wants to update the data with permission then we use special methods known
as getters and setters.
