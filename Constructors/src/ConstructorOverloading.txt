Introduction to Constructor Overloading
Constructor overloading provides a way to define multiple constructors in a class, each with a unique set of parameters. 
This is useful when you want to initialize objects in different states or with different initial values depending on the available 
information or specific requirements.

Benefits of Constructor Overloading
Flexibility: Enables the initialization of objects in different configurations, catering to various needs and scenarios.

Clarity and Readability: Each constructor’s parameters clearly define what information is required for the object’s creation, making 
the code easier to understand and use.

Customization: Different constructors can set up an object in completely different states, providing great flexibility within the 
same class structure.


Best Practices
Keep it Simple: Avoid overloading with too many constructors as it can make the code hard to maintain. Instead, focus on a few key 
configurations that are actually beneficial.

Clear Documentation: Each constructor should be well documented to explain what it does and the parameters it requires.

Constructor Chaining: Where appropriate, use constructor chaining to maximize code reuse and minimize redundancy.
