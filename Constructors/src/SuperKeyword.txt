SUPER KEYWORD

The super keyword in java is a reference variable that is used to refer to parent class objects. It is commonly
used for three main purposes : To access the methods of the parent class, to access the constructor of the parent class,
and to access the fields of the parent class if they are shadowed by any subclasses.

Why use the super keyword?
-> Method Overriding: To call the parent class's method when it has been overridden by the subclass
-> Field access: To access the fields of the parent class that are hidden by the child class fields

Example:

class Vehicle {
    String name = "Generic Vehicle";

    public void start() {
        System.out.println(name + " is starting.");
    }
}

class Car extends Vehicle {
    // Shadowing the name field from Vehicle
    String name = "Car";

    public void start() {
        // Call to parent method
        super.start();
        System.out.println(this.name + " is starting with a key turn.");
    }

    public void displayName() {
        // Accessing the parent class's name field using super
        System.out.println("Parent name: " + super.name);
        System.out.println("Car name: " + this.name);
    }
}

public class TransportTest {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Car myCar = new Car();
        myCar.start();  // Demonstrates method access
        myCar.displayName();  // Demonstrates field access
    }
}
